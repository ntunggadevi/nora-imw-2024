        <h4>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h4>
        <p>
            The thesis of this article is that screens become a reflection of what the creators want to make of them. We
            can
            freely choose what we want to display on our screens using its form and how we can interact with it. Over
            time,
            screens adapt to the trends that society puts on them. An example that Chimero stated was that in the
            beginning,
            screens show icons that reflect how the real-life object of that icon looks like, then over time, those
            icons
            are made to look modern and simplistic. Chimero points out that these changes happen very often so now we
            are
            accustomed to the ever-changing skeuomorphism on our screens as they adapt. As screens evolve, not only are
            there skeuomorphic icons, but animations are also added to add interactivity and responsiveness for the user
            and
            simplify how the content flows and is shown on the screen. Chimero calls this aspect of screen use “flux.”
            Another point Chimero made is that we can adapt what is seen on our screens to not be based on the popular
            views
            of society but through the lenses of “extensibility, openness, communication, community, wildness.” He
            claims
            that efficiency in interfaces leads to screens being tools that are useful to help people in their lives.

        <h4>2. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?</h4>
        <p>
            I stand in the middle of the two ideological camps. Both have their positive and negative sides. For
            example,
            for
            icons, I love how clean flat designs can be seen on the screen, but I dislike how sometimes they do not
            reflect
            what they are supposed to be so the meaning behind the design is lost immediately. On the other hand, icons
            that
            are skeuo can be extremely helpful and straightforward to show what the applications can do although they
            may
            look cluttered and less aesthetically pleasing. When thinking of flat and skeuo, flat is aimed at the
            younger
            and modern population, while skeuo is intended for the more retro and older population. I stated before that
            I
            stand in between these two ideological camps because if we could take the straightforwardness of skeuo
            designs
            and the cleanliness of flat designs, then it would have created efficiencies while also having aestheticism
            within our screens.

        <h4>3. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from
            filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</h4>
        <p>
            Zoopraxiscope is an invention by Eadweard Muybridge of a disk that when spun, shows a looped animation of a
            horse running using images taken in seconds. Chimero compared the zoopraxiscope to the marriage of
            filmmaking
            and web & interaction design. He also stated that from the beginning screens only take the form of what the
            creator wants it to be, never mind its aesthetic so furthermore, web & interaction design can be shaped to
            reflect our visions. Another form from another medium that has inspired digital design can be found in the
            marketing and advertising aspect of the web. Before there was the internet, advertisers would capture the
            eyes
            of potential customers using bright colors and flashy display fonts. Nowadays, the web relies on views to
            make a
            profit, especially in entertainment, so thumbnail art or cover art for video entertainment is particularly
            important for engagement with the audience. As you can see in the images below, the similarity between the
            Walmart flyer and my YouTube homepage is that both are flashy in a way to attract the eyes of the viewer. On
            the
            Walmart flyer, they highlighted the point of interest of what they are advertising very clearly by using
            bright
            colours, clear product pictures, and large fonts. On the YouTube homepage, commonly, the videos try to
            attract
            the attention of the viewers by using thumbnails with large fonts that describe the gist or point of
            interest in
            the video while also adding some crazy images or facial expressions to further attract the attention of the
            viewers. Both media requires to engage in the attention of the public audience.
