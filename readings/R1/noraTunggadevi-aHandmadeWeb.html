        <h4>1. What is the thesis of this article? </h4>
        <p>The thesis of this article is that handmade websites are websites that are programmed by an individual from
            scratch that is unique in their designs and content. Rather than a huge company that runs the website, it is
            solely the independent maker(s) of the website that oversees running it. The handmade websites are also a
            contemporary to the style and personality of the creators and how they want to arrange their content; there
            are
            no rules set that bounds the creativity of the handmade website inventor. By creating handmade websites,
            there
            are more thoughts and skill that goes into the creation than creating a website that is made using the help
            of
            another software. Making a handmade website meant that the websites made can be as limited or as
            outrageously
            creative as the makers intended. Instead of the typical website using the use of the traditional grids and
            regular texts, creators of handmade websites can create a webpage that reflects their individuality.
            <br>
            <br>
            <i align="center">“I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
                software;
                web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which
                are
                provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing,
                design,
                ownership, privacy, security, or identity.”</i> (Carpenter)
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?
        </h4>
        <p>The form of resistance of handmade website refers to the resisting of creating a website that follows the
            guidelines that a modern traditional website follows. Most commercial websites are formed to have things
            such as
            the algorithm and consumerism in mind so to be profitable. Handmade websites are made by those who resist
            the
            conventional and they strive to create something unique and innovative which in turn can also be made to be
            profitable. They also may resist the urge to create a website that seems widely socially acceptable and
            average
            to look at. This allows them to create something out worldly and unique. In terms of resistance, a handmade
            website could also resist the thought of making profitability. Instead of profitability, they could focus
            more
            on creativity, skill development of the creator, experimentation, and even for the sake of the entertainment
            of
            the programmer with little to no thoughts of profitability. </p>
        <br>
        <h4>3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the "physicality" of the
            web? </h4>
        <p>On the web, there are plenty of restriction regarding what could be done. For example, you cannot make
            something
            that is three-dimensional on the computer screen. It only seems three-dimensional, but you can’t hold those
            objects in your hand. Due to this limitation, programmers must be creative when they want to create a
            meaningful
            message or unique experiences. A favourite example of mine is <a href="neal.fun">neal.fun</a> which is a
            website
            created by a talented creative web developer, Neal Agarwal. Agarwal created plenty of interesting website
            covering all sorts of topics! Using the web, he is breaking barriers of what can be done when building
            handmade
            websites. One of a favourite of mine is <a href="https://neal.fun/space-elevator/"><i>“Space
                    Elevator”</i></a>
            where viewers can scroll up to get higher into space using an elevator. While going up, visitors can read
            fun
            facts of the sky and space with fun visuals attached so it is easy to understand. What I like about this
            site is
            that Agarwal uses the simple interaction of scrolling up to represent the action for going up to space in an
            elevator, which recently is being researched by scientists and is a possibility to happen in the future. By
            using simple interaction, websites can also seem very creative and innovative. </p>
