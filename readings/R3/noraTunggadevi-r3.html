    <h4>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please
        explain your answer.</h4>
    <p>
        Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because she claims that the World Wide Web
        is meant for individuality instead of only for big social media corporations such as, Facebook/Instagram,
        Twitter, and Google to make profit. By creating individual websites, the web becomes more of a space to express
        creativity independently rather than follow the algorithms and trends of what surfaces on large social media
        sites. While I do agree with Schwulstâ€™s message about the advocacy of individual websites, at the moment, it is
        still more simple and efficient to create one or multiple social media accounts than to make handmade individual
        website pages. Creating a website is not a simple task, there are plenty of syntax and code to learn about
        making an individual website. Sure, there are applications that could help to create a website, such as, Wix and
        Google Sites, but there are still paywalls to get a personal domain and to advertise the website, so it is known
        by the world. In comparison, making a social media account is free, more accessible for everyone, and easier to
        share anything to anyone in the world. Thus, social media accounts are faster and easier to manage than personal
        websites for the regular person who do not have previous knowledge of web programming.

    <h4>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph
        describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that
        comparison.</h4>
