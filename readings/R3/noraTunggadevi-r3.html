        <h4>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her?
            Please
            explain your answer.</h4>
        <p>
            Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because she claims that the World Wide
            Web
            is meant for individuality instead of only for big social media corporations such as, Facebook/Instagram,
            Twitter, and Google to make profit. By creating individual websites, the web becomes more of a space to
            express
            creativity independently rather than follow the algorithms and trends of what surfaces on large social media
            sites. While I do agree with Schwulstâ€™s message about the advocacy of individual websites, at the moment, it
            is
            still more simple and efficient to create one or multiple social media accounts than to make handmade
            individual
            website pages. Creating a website is not a simple task, there are plenty of syntax and code to learn about
            making an individual website. Sure, there are applications that could help to create a website, such as, Wix
            and
            Google Sites, but there are still paywalls to get a personal domain and to advertise the website, so it is
            known
            by the world. In comparison, making a social media account is free, more accessible for everyone, and easier
            to
            share anything to anyone in the world. Thus, social media accounts are faster and easier to manage than
            personal
            websites for the regular person who do not have previous knowledge of web programming.
        </p>
        <h4>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a
            paragraph
            describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend
            that
            comparison.</h4>
