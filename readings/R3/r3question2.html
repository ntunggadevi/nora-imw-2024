        <p>A website is a collection playlist full of music with different genres, emotions, and style.</p>
        <p>In this
            collection, one playlist might reflect your favourite music, another one could reflect music that
            inspires
            you, and the last one can be about just the ups and downs of life in general.</p>
        <p>It does not have to only be
            these three topics, but as life goes on and more things are experienced, hence more playlists are
            added to
            the collection with different feelings, ideas, and story to be visited and enjoyed in the future as
            records
            of memories. These playlists are what webpages are to websites.</p>
