        <h3>Story Description</h3>
        <p>This project was based on the things I saw while on a family trip to Alberta and BC, Canada in the Summer of
            2021. A week or two before we went on our trip, there was a huge wildfire that happened in the forests of
            Alberta and British Columbia. This wildfire has affected the clarity of the landscape and the air that
            surrounds the affected areas. </p>

        <H3>Stages of the Project</H3>
        <H4>I. Ideation </H4>
        <p>One of the most difficult part of this project was creating a concept for it. I knew from before I wanted to
            do something from my travelling but I wasn't sure at first what kind of story I want to tell. I wanted to
            highlight the fun I had while I was on the trip. I was trying to figure out some ideas on Figma. One of the
            ideas was when the viewer clicks the car, they would go to a scene where they can explore inside the car.
            The first thing I thought was playing the radio, so I started to sketch the idea on Figma.</p>

        <br>
        <p class="center">Sketch of radio feature of storybook in Figma</p>
        <br>
        <p>I do like using Figma, but I feel like it restricts me to play with the web development since I don't know
            too much about css, I decided to skip the planning step and just move on with the experimentation so I could
            figure out what I want in a more efficient manner. To start off, I decided to make the scene of the
            mountains first and just see where my mind would take me.</p>

        <p class="center">First experimentation with HTML and CSS</p>

        <H4>II. Experimentation and Interactivity</H4>
        <p>After making the scene of the mountains, I questioned myself where would I want this to go? On the trip, I
            spent a lot of time on the road, so I thought that the best idea was to let the user go into the car. That's
            where the idea that I sketched on Figma comes in handy. I started to create a simple dash of a car with the
            window and radio being interactive. I actually thought about the fire hazard slip later on after I made the
            forest fire scene.</p>

        <h4>III. Seeing a clearer picture of where I want my story to go and finalization</h4>
        <p>Since I tested out that the radio worked, I wanted to take this project to the next level. This is where the
            idea of creating a story about the wildfire takes place. First, I thought about the heat wave that occured
            that summer in Alberta and BC that might be a factor to the wildfires. So, I decide to create a sun that
            looks really hot to the point that the sky around is a fiery red colour. This was inspired by the sun of the
            "Rooms in the Mountain" by Rosa Chung. I really liked the way that their sun seems to expel heat by making
            it at the center of the page. I think that was the perfect way that I could show how hot the sun was.</p>

        <p class="center">The sun in <a href="https://rschung4.github.io/interactive/assignments/room3.html">"The Rooms

        <img class="image center" src="./WIP_Pictures/nora-sun.jpeg">
        <br>
        <p class="center">My sun scene.</p>
        <br>
        <p>After the sun, I thought about making a scene where the viewers would see the forest fire. I used simple
            shapes such as ovals and rectangles to create the burning trees and smoke. I decided at the bottom of the
            page to create an audio control for the fire sound effect to set the mood of the wildfire happening. The
            viewer can go back to the first scene by clicking the smoke. This represents how the smoke spreads
            everywhere around where the wildfire occured.</p>

        <p class="center">Forest Fire created using simple shapes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, I thought about the outline of the story and how to bridge the forest fire and the car together. I
            remembered when we were on the roadtrip to Banff, they gave us a special booklet that warns us about the
            fire hazard of the forest and how open fires are restricted in the park to prevent wildfires. Since the
            wildfires were happening, I decided to create a slip noting how high the fire warning was on the scale. When
            viewers click on the pointer on the slip, it will go to a scene where the hot sun is shown. That's how I
            bridged the car scene and the forest fire scene at the end.</p>
