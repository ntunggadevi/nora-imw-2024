        <p>The interaction that was assigned to me was resize. In class, we had looked at some examples of
            websites that had
            some interaction embedded into them. One of the websites that inspired me and related to my interaction most
            was
            <a href="https://endless-summer.richardmille.com/">"Endless Summer" by Richard Mille</a>. This site uses
            browser
            resize to lower and heighten a sun in the sky while also changing colour to the sky for added sunset effect.
            <br>
            After seeing the websites, I was eager to start experimenting with coding my webpage. My first idea was that
            I
            attempted to replicate <a href="https://endless-summer.richardmille.com/">"Endless Summer" by Richard
                Mille</a> where I have a component in the website move up and down when the web browser is resized. I
            wanted
            to make a "submarine" that moves vertically in the browser as it is resized. I attempted to create this
            concept
            using only HTML and CSS,
            but I turned this idea down quickly since I realized that it was a boring concept for me and too simple; I
            want
            something more
            exciting!

        </center>

        <p>
            This is where I was having a very challenging time finding what to do. I decided that it was best to take a
            break
            from the project as I was having a "coder's block" for a few weeks. The week when we learned about p5.js was
            the
            week I started to pickup the project again and start anew with my experimentation. I'm actually a beginner
            to
            JQuery and Vanilla Javascript, so I was not fully comfortable with using them yet for this project, hence
            why I
            wanted to use p5.js since I had experience coding with this flavour of Javascript. Also, with the time
            alotted,
            I knew from experience that p5.js can help me do something pretty cool and exciting with minimal and
            uncomplicated logic.
            <br>
            Moving on with what to do next with p5.js, I still had a difficult time making my mind on what to make. I
            started messing around with the drawing with p5.js code we learned in class and I started to experiment with
            what happened if I used "windowWidth" and "windowHeight" for the x and y axis of a circle. When I tried the
            code, nothing showed up and thats when I realized I had to offset the x and y axis of the circle so that it
            would appear on the screen. I used the windowWidth-100 and windowHeight-100 expression respectively in the x
            and
            y syntax of the circle and once I run the code it returned something very impressive on the screen; I could
            draw
            using the window resize!

            <p>Playing around with p5.js to create a drawing experience with the browser resize feature.</p>
        </center>
        <p>
            Though it was pretty cool, I was having a difficult time with the math since whenever the drawing was done,
            it
            could not fill the whole screen, only half of the screen. I tinkered with the numbers over and over again
            but
            the issue still persist. <br> Here's when I briefly gave up on this idea and tried to make a sketch where a
            ball
            would bounce around in the window and when it is resized, it will adjust automatically to the window size. I
            used a tutorial by <a href="https://youtu.be/Kp070rI_G48">Mr. Erdreich on YouTube</a> to help me figure out
            the
            logic of a
            bouncing ball. Once I learned how to do it, I inputed the windowWidth and windowHeight code to where the
            ball
            detect collision. This code did work perfectly but I didn't like that it was still too simple for the
            viewer. So
            then I was stuck again on what to do. I kept on experimenting over and over again thinking that I'll find
            something I like. I wanted to try making a ballpit simulation with adding more balls (I looked at the
            tutorial
            <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/2sman/sketches/Hysj-cm-f">"Basic Collision" by 2sman on p5.js</a> to learn
            collision) but I was
            having a difficult time with figuring out how to make the balls collide with each other so I scrapped the
            idea
            of the ballpit due to time constraints. I went back to the drawing with resize idea and continued working on
            it
            to add cooler effects. I started to put in the windowHeight and windowWidth code into the size of the circle
            and
            offset it so its not as big as the screen so it is still viewable. Then, I changed the circle to an ellipse
            so I
            can change its height and width. The result was unique! As you resize the window, the shape of the ellipse
            change in height or width depending of the size of the window.

        <p> I was proud with what I came up with but I still wanted to make something even more amazing! I looked at the
            reference page of p5.js and looked at what else I can do. I stumbled upon this <a
                href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle">triangle page on the p5.js reference</a> and that's when
            I
            remembered that I can use 3D rotate to animate the circle to make it look better.</p>

        </center>
        <p>It was very cool to see the screen creating something automatically while using the resize feature. Each time
            I
            reset the page was like creating an abstract piece of art as I get a different result everytime I play
            around
            with the window resize. I tried to change the aesthetic of the drawing and played around with the animation
            as
            you can see in these images below.</p>

        </center>
        <p>I decided that I want the final aesthetic to be a dark background with colourful outlines. This reminds me a
            lot
            of a topographic map which I think is pretty cool! I followed a p5.js sketch called <a
                href="https://editor.p5js.org/lberdugo/sketches/BJG10p4dZ">"timer_backgroundColorChange" by Iberdugo on
                the
                p5.js editor</a> to help figure out how to change the colour of the outline of the circle every 7.5
            seconds.
