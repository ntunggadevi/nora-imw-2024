        <h3>I. Research</h3>
        <h4>a. Typeface & Fonts</h4>
        <p>For this project, I have chosen to tackle to work on the web poster of the event "Maria Hupfield: The One Who
            Keeps
            On Giving." First of all, I researched what type of event it is so that I can reflect it towards the design
            I
            wanted
            to do. I went to the website of the event and it mentioned that it is an event to show arts and culture from
            Canadian First Nations artist Maria Hupfield. Diving deeper into my research about Maria Hupfield I found
            out
            that
            she is Anishinaabe specifically Ojibwe. In another course, I learned that the first peoples of Canada has
            their
            own
            syllabics, so I had to include a similar typeface to the Cree syllabics into my poster somehow. I looked up
            a
            poster
            of an event for Canadian First Nations and I found one with a typeface that I liked.</p>

        <img class="images center" src="WIP/type1.jpeg">

        <p>I used a font matching site to figure out what font the title of the poster was. I came across a very similar
            font in Adobe fonts called "P22 Arts and Crafts Bold" which I chose to use in the final version of the
            webpage.
            For the text of "Maria Hupfield", I did some trial and errors to see other fonts that would look similar to
            the
            way that the written Cree syllabics are geometric. I decided to use the font "Megrim" from Google Fonts
            since it
            matches my criteria most.</p>

        <img class="center images" src="WIP/choosing-type.jpeg">

        <p>For the body copy, it was easy to find the font that I wanted to use. On the Adobe Fonts page of "P22 Arts
            and
            Crafts Bold", there was some font pairing suggestions. These suggestions are very helpful since it was not
            hard
            for me to choose a typeface that fits well to my concept. I chose the font "Transat Standard" for my final
            webpage since I love how the font is sharp and geometric while also being legible.</p>

        <h4>b. Layout Research</h4>
        <p>Finding out what layout fits best to the event was not easy. While having to perfectly fit the event, the
            layout
            must be simple enough so that I would not have a difficult time creating it. I made three ideas in Figma of
            what
            the layout might look like.</p>

        <img class="center images" src="WIP/layoutResearch.jpeg">

        <p>As you can see the first layout idea was based on the Medicine Wheel tradition of the Canadian First Nation.
            At
            first, I had an idea that for
            each
            of the coloured tiles of the Medicine Wheel it would zoom in on hover to fill the page. However, that idea
            quickly failed since I do not like the layout and how the colours are working together and with the event.
            Also,
            it was difficult to place the event information logically</p>

        <video controls class="center">
            <source src="WIP/layout1Vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <p>The second layout idea was inspired by the layout of the exhibition itself. Using the neon yellow background
            and
            simple shapes such as squares, rectangles, and circles I could replicate the layout of the exhibition on the
            webpage. I like this idea even more than the first one, but the problem was that I could not think of
            creative
            interactions that the user could do on the webpage that would fit the aesthetic of the exhibition. What I
            tried
            with this layer was making the title glow which is pretty cool, but it did not exactly fit the contemporary
            look
            I was looking for.</p>

        <img class="center" src="WIP/layout2.jpeg">

        <p>The third layout idea was taken from "Jingle Boots" which was one of the featured works of Maria Hupfield on
            the
            exhibition. I noticed that many of Hupfield's featured works display fringes. I thought that it would be
            interesting to re-create these fringes on my poster webpage and have it swing out to reveal the information
            of
            the event beneath it. As the call-to-action buttons, I wanted to keep in mind the layout of the exhibition
            display to make an interesting menu.</p>

        <img class="center" src="WIP/Layout3-inspiration.jpeg">

        <h3>II. Programming the Poster</h3>

        <h4>a. The Prototype</h4>
        <p>One of the most challenging aspects to making the poster webpage was to figure out how to make the fringes
            swing
            and putting the information on the background. To make the layout of the fringes, I made a prototype webpage
            to
            test out how the fringes would work.</p>

        <img class="center" src="WIP/prototypeFringe.jpeg">

        <p>On this prototype, the most demanding work was to hide the information behind
            the fringes so that it would not show on top or overflow the fringes. I decided to widen the fringes so that
            the
            information behind can be hidden perfectly behind them while not making the width too thin since that would
            make
            reading the information too difficult. I learned that I could put the event information behind the fringes
            by
            using the z-index which added a depth layering aspect to the webpage.</p>

        <img class="center" src="WIP/widenFringes.jpeg">

        <h3>b. Making of the Final</h3>

        <p>Once I figured out the logic behind the fringes, I started creating the final webpage. I spent many hours
            making
            the layout perfect with functioning animation. First, I dealt with the title and the subtitles of the event
            information.</p>
        <section class="grid">
            <section class="grid-item">
                <img class="grid-images" src="WIP/Final1.jpeg">
            </section>
            <section class="grid-item">
                <img class="grid-images" src="WIP/Final2.jpeg">
            </section>
        </section>
        <p>Then, I added the footer of the webpage. I wanted the footer to inform the viewers about the sponsors of the
            event since in my previous experiences I have noticed that the footer is where sponsors are located
            typically.
        </p>

        <img class="center" src="WIP/footerAdded.jpeg">

        <p>The next thing I added was the menu. I knew I wanted the menu to be interesting to interact with. I looked at
            other event websites and I came across the website for the Casa Loma. I see that their menu was in the
            header
            which I want to replicate with my layout.</p>

        <img class="center" src="WIP/casaLoma.jpeg">

        <p>I still was inspired to create something that reflect the layout of the exhibition display. I attempted to
            replicate the way that Hupfield placed the objects on the display which was tilted and not perfectly
            aligned.
        </p>

        <img class="center" src="WIP/menuAdded.jpeg">

        <p>Using CSS grid, I was able to lay everything out the way I wanted fairly easily. I even added animation to
            the
            menu which at the end I was very happy with the result.</p>

        <p>Moving on with the project, I added a page for the about section. I realized that putting the about section
            on
            the landing page would make it too crowded. With this about page, I wanted to have a similar style of menu
            that
            I created for the main page. Instead of using the circle shape to go back, I used the triangle pointed to
            the
            left and added animation to that as well.
        </p>
